# 1 Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to get familiar with testing services provided by java. We were supposed to use testing tools such as JUnit framework to test different algorithms for JFreeChart. To make sure our testing was thorough and efficient, for harder tests we used mock objects to simulate the condition, and for simpler tests we used unit tests. All of this was done on Eclipse as instructed by our lab document.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

We designed our unit testing by using two black box strategies called boundary value testing (BVT) and equivalence class testing (ECT). ECT was used to identity the input partitions for the methods. It was based on the output that was anticapted behaviour based on the inputs. The BVt was used to after we had established the minimum and maximum values that the method can accept as an input. To implement the strategies we will use JUnit testing. Moreover, for the tests that depended on DOCs, we used JMock to create mock tests which allowed us to see the behaviour and the test results in depth.

The DataUtilities test that we chose are:

calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column)
calculateRowTotal(Values2D data, int row)
createNumberArray(double[] data)
createNumberArray2D(double[][] data)
getCumulativePercentages(KeyedValues data)

The Range test that we chose are:

getLowerBound()
getUpperBound()
getLength()
constrain(double value)
combine(Range range1, Range range2)

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

During the lab time period we went over all the tests that were required for this lab. We discussed the tests and mutaully came up with what kind of JUnit and JMock tests will be required for specific methods in the JFreeChart system. Since we were supposed to do ten tests, Muteeba and Shahzill did 3 of the tests each whereas Rumaisa and Iman did two tests each. To make the workload more even, Iman and Rumaisa did the greater part of the report whereas Shahzill and Muteeba worked on the introduction and conclusion. 

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

For this lab, we had to work on our test files on Eclipse. As not everyone on the team was familiar with using Eclipse, we had to take some time installing and learning how to work on this platform before starting the contents of the lab. We divided the workload amongst us for efficiency, with each of us doing 2-3 tests. Whenever a test case failed, it was difficult to confirm if there was a bug or if there was a mistake made in the code. We overcame this by having at least two people review test-cases for a method that one member was confused about. Throughout this assignment, our group had the opportunity to work with Eclipse and learn about Black Box Testing, where we could write and carry out test cases even without knowing the full implementation of the program.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The lab document had step-by-step instructions on working with an Eclipse project and understanding how to use JUnit and JFreeChart, which we found pretty useful. We were able to experience how Black Box testing works through JMock and JUnit 4, and it was pretty fun to run some of the tests.
